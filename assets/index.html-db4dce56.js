First, the background on coordinated control of multi-ASV systems are briefly introduced. Second, some challenging issues and scenarios in motion control of ASVs are presented. Third, recent results on trajectory-guided, path-guided, and target-guided coordinated control of multiple ASVs are reviewed in detail. Fourth, coordinated target enclosing of multiple ASVs with experiments is presented. Finally, several theoretical and technical issues are suggested to direct future investigations.

Traditional supervised learning aims to train a classifier in the closed-set world, where training and test samples share the same label space. However, in a real-world application, it is very difficult to classify accurately where it needs to deal with unknown classes. A more realistic scenario is open-set classification or open-set recognition. This requires the classifiers to not only accurately classify the known classes but also effectively deal with unknown ones that were not anticipated during the training phase. This special session is organized to focus on the recent development of open-set learning and diagnostics.

As we all know, DNNs are data-driven, depending on the size and quality of the training data. Therefore, it seems that DNNs are vulnerable while attackers have access to the training data and they can make DNNs misclassify by modifying even a small proportion of the data. As a result, the poisoned model may not work as people originally expected. For example, the classification accuracy may drop dramatically and in a stealthier way, the classification accuracy will just decrease on some target poisoned samples and behave normally on other benign samples. To this end, we need to pay more attention to the poisoning attack in deep neural networks (DNNs).
